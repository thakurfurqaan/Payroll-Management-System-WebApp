### DESCRIPTION
There is a need to develop a Database Management System for maintaining the Payroll of ABC Organization. ABC needs a system which allows the employees to have their information available on their online portals. The system generates their Net Income based on the deductions, allowances and leaves. 

The proposed system is a web based application where employees and admin can login to their respective accounts and take advantage of their privileges in the most user-friendly manner possible. The admin has command over the salaries of the employees existing in the company. The admin can search for the employees easily which uses a complex search filtering algorithm which takes into consideration only the filled fields and returns highly optimised table of results of the employees which satisfy the condition. The admin can then click on ‘View’ to update the basic details as well as salary of the employees and add leaves as well. The admin can change their password also. 

There are three modules: 
1. Admin 
2. Existing Employee 
3. New Employee 

New employees can register using their basic details and they are provided a unique ID which can be used along with their password to log in to their freshly created accounts. The admin can then access these accounts to enter their salary and update their details. Existing employees can log in to their accounts and see their details as well as change their phone number and password.
